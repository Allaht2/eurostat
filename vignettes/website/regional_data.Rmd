## Motivation

Working with regional data has many advantages and many challenges. I had three aims when creating this article:

- I wanted to highlight how you can use existing eurostat functions to work with Eurostat's regional products;
- To create simple helper functions and guidance on more complex data manipulations to improve the quality of the raw regional data;
- To start a dialogue on improving the data products of Eurostat.

The advantage over national data is lies in the homogeneity in units, and the larger number of units, which enables us to better understand social and economic differences.  National boundaries, i.e. NUTS0 regions, are historical and political constructions. They greatly vary in size and complexity.  Within the EU, Germany and Malta are equally NUTS0 regions or countries, although Malta’s size would make it a small NUTS3 region in Germany.  Comparing Germany with Malta hides a huge diversity within Germany.

Statistical regions are largely homogeneous in size and in urban complexity.  The smallest, NUTS3 region are cities, or towns with their rural hinterland; it can be expected that most people go to school or work within this region.  Malta itself is the size of a NUTS3 region, so it could be compared with the NUTS3 regions of Germany the most meaningfully.  NUTS1 units are usually provinces of larger countries, such as Bavaria in Germany.  NUTS2 units comprise of (usually) several NUTS3 units within a NUTS1 large region.

The smallest member states are the size of NUTS2 and NUTS3 regions and can be best compared with all the similar sized regions of Europe.  Bit larger member states like Slovakia are NUTS1 regions, and they can be best compared with all NUTS1 regions of Europe:  Bavaria and Slovakia make a more meaningful comparison in many cases than Germany and Slovakia.
There are several difficulties with working on sub-national level of data.These are related to data availability, changes in boundaries, and data & metadata quality.  

### Boundary changes

Changes in boundaries meant that unlike national boundaries, regional boundaries change very often. Since standardizing the NUTS regions in 2003 with the EU, boundary changes were made on average every three years.  Boundary changes make organizing data panels (which are several time instances of the cross section regional data) very tedious. 

### Data availability and quality

Data availability means that many statistical produces are only available on NUTS0 country level.  The creation of NUTS1-NUTS3 statistics is usually slow and the data product range is narrower at these levels.  

NUTS-level data is often disaggregated with the use of various estimations from higher levels. While some original data sources are available from NUTS3 levels (or even higher geographical resolution data, i.e. lower level of aggregation level), such as population or mortality data, many economic activities are theoretically difficult to be connected to one place and geographical disaggregation is only estimated. For example, since the GDP is mainly produced in companies, and many companies work in several locations across municipal and regional borders, locating their contribution to the GDP is the result of a more or less precise estimation.

Pan-European surveys are very important data sources for many social data products, but they are often created with the use of nationally representative samples.  Even if they contain regional coding, and they can be re-arranged into regional statistics, the results are of lower quality, as the original survey sample is not representative to each and every NUTS2 or NUTS3 region of Germany, for example.  (Of course, since Malta is a NUTS2 region, survey data from Malta is representative on NUTS2 = NUTS1 = NUTS0 level.)  Practically this means that many statistical products of Eurostat are mixed products, i.e. they contain NUTS1 level data for larger member states, such as Germany, France or Italy, and they contain NUTS2 level data for other member states.

One problem of Eurostat's data products is that they have no legal mandate to force national statistical offices to create consistent datasets. Sometimes data 'goes missing' because the national statistical offices, which is responsible for the quality and validity of the data, does not recode the historical data with new geographic label definitions.  

### Metadata quality

And at last, the metadata quality of Eurostat’s products is not as good as on NUTS0 national level. A particularly problematic issue is that Eurostat’s tables do not differentiate between the current NUTS2016 regional boundaries and the NUTS2013 or NUTS2010 boundaries.  Some data tables contain rows that cannot and must not be compared.  For example, France went under a very thorough change in its regional boundaries, meaning that NUTS2013 regional data from 2013 can only be compared in the case of a very small fraction of the country with NUTS2016 data from 2016 or 2018. 

You can download the correspondence table in Excel.

```{r download, eval=FALSE}
# download to a temporary file 
tf <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")
download.file(url = 'https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/345175/629341/NUTS2013-NUTS2016.xlsx', destfile = tf,  mode = 'wb'  )
```

The correspondence table(s) are not tidy, and they are in several sheets which are not fully consistent.  The name of the French region `FR7` or Centre-Est is marked as `discontinued` in the sheet `Correspondence NUTS-1` and at the same time as `relabelled and recoded` to `FRK`, or Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes. We believe that the latter case is correct and use only this row in the correspondence table to avoid duplications in joining.

Furthermore, Eurostat has a very problematic practice with simply removing statistical products when metadata definitions change.  So, you may have downloaded industry-level data with the NACE Rev 2 definition or French regional data with the NUTS 2013 definition, but under the same title, you will be downloading a differently defined dataset in 2020.  Or, you will not be able to reproduce your code, because they will remove the data with your earlier definition.  While it is clear that Eurostat cannot take care of boundary changes if the responsible national statistical offices fail to do this, removing the history of data products makes the validation of professional and academic work made with such data impossible in some cases. 

The logical workflow is the following:

- understand how different parts of your data are affected by the problem, particularly if you want to join different data sets, such as GDP with population;
- correct metadata (labelling) errors;
- impute additive data based on the correspondence table;
- impute non-additive data from larger territorial units;
- optionally estimate non-additive boundary change effects.

Instead of creating only the correction functions, I added a few further steps down the road, because if you work with different dataset, not to mention different data sources, the problem may be different in each dataset that you try to join.  

# Taking care of boundaries

Most regional statistical products are made on the NUTS2 level, or they are mixed NUTS1-NUTS2 level statistics.  This means that usually you have 150-300 units to compare, which is gives an unprecedented richness in cross-sectional analysis.  Most US or Australian datasets are not so detailed in cross-section, and data availability in the rest of the world is just lower.

The power of statistical analysis can be increased when you order such data into panels, because the different change in a time interval in this huge cross-section contains usually a lot more information about the underlying social or economic process.  However, organizing panels – or just simple time series of an individual region – is often hindered by changes in regional boundaries.

A simple strategy is to create a _panel of only those data that do not change boundaries_.  However, if you have many variables, this leads very quickly to a huge loss in data, because missing data is often independent from boundary changes.  With the addition of each new variable you are likely to loose new and new rows of observations. 

Keeping track of the changes is a much better strategy, and up to a point, it is a costless in the amount of work, because often _only the metadata is changing_. Member states, when they change tow regions’ boundary only, will nevertheless create new regional codes for all their regions, to make sure that regional labels do not mix. However, Eurostat is not following this practice well, and it does mixes up different labels.

With the new helper function `check_nuts_2013()` you can see if your geo label codes are affected by these changes, and you get a first view on how you can continue your work.

```{r checknuts2013}
eurostat::tgs00026 %>%
  filter ( time == 2012 ) %>%
  harmonize_geo_code() 
```

Zooming on regions `UKM` you can see that `UKM5` and `UKM6` are unchanged, `UKM3` gave birth to two new regional units `UKM8` and `UKM9` (this is an additive change) and `UKM2` lost a NUTS3 unit `UKM24`. This latter one is also an additive change, but maybe far more difficult to handle in practice, because data about `UKM24` may not be available in most cases, as NUTS1 and NUTS2 level data is only available for a very few basic indicators on NUTS3 level. You can, however, easily maintain backward compatibility among `UKM3`, `UKM8`, `UKM9`, because the new data is just available in higher resolution, or, in other words, for two halves of the earlier `UKM3` region.

```{r checknutsUK}
# for readability the previous example is filtered and reduced
eurostat::tgs00026 %>%
  filter ( time == 2012 ) %>%
  harmonize_geo_code() %>%
  filter ( grepl("UKM", geo) ) %>%
  select ( geo, values, change )
```

For easier filtering in further use, there are two logical variables added to the data frame, i.e. `nuts_2013` and `nuts_2016`. Many datasets contain non-EU regions not covered in the Eurostat correspondence tables, their filter is `nuts_2013 == FALSE & nuts_2016 == FALSE`.

The following example will filter out all rows that use a geo code which is defined in NUTS2013 and cannot be found in NUTS2016.  These are the main sources of incompatibility in your data panel.

```{r filterdifference}
eurostat::tgs00026 %>%
  filter ( time == 2012 ) %>%
  check_nuts_2013() %>%
  filter ( nuts_2013, ! nuts_2016 ) 
```

## Recoding needed: only the metadata changed

The first, logical step is to find those data points which are in fact identical, only their regional codes have changed.  For example, `FRC1` is in fact identical to region with the NUTS2013 label `FR26` (Bourgogne region in France.)  In this case, you can simply re-label the regions that appear to be different just because of the different codes applied.
		
The helper function `harmonize_geo_code()` will assist you with these cases. 

To make the example more clear, let's zoom on changes in France.  You can see that many regions changes, but some of them only changed labels.  For forward compatibility,  `harmonize_geo_code()` changed all geo labels to the current, `NUTS2016` definition. In fact, this is needed to use maps, for example. 

```{r harmonizeFR}
# for readability the previous example is filtered and reduced
eurostat::tgs00026 %>%
  filter ( time == 2012 ) %>%
  harmonize_geo_code() %>%
  filter ( grepl("FR", geo) ) %>%
  select ( geo, code13,  code16, change, values )
```

In the change log, `recoded` means that the geo code was changed in the transition to NUTS2016, `recoded and relabelled` means that not only the code, but also the official name of the region changed.

You can decide which coding you prefer to use. Beware to use consistent map definitions if you will visualize your work - you can add the NUTS2013 labelled data to a map that contains the NUTS2013 boundary definitions.

For comparing with additional data sources, it may be useful to make sure that you use the current name of the region. Function `recode_to_nuts_2016()` changes the name column to the NUTS2016 definition, when applicable, and `recode_to_nuts_2013()` will use the earlier definition.

```{r convertFR}
# for readability the previous example is filtered and reduced
eurostat::tgs00026 %>%
  filter ( time == 2012 ) %>%
  recode_to_nuts_2016() %>%
  filter ( grepl("FR", geo) ) %>%
  select ( geo, name,  code16, change, resolution, values )
```

Another useful filter is `change == "not in the EU"`.  The non-EU member state region definitions (and their possible changes) are not covered in the Eurostat correspondence table.  

```{r convertfilter}
# for readability the previous example is filtered and reduced
eurostat::tgs00026 %>%
  filter ( time == 2012 ) %>%
   recode_to_nuts_2016() %>%
   filter ( ! nuts_2013, ! nuts_2016 )
```

You may need to review these manually, and if you have a problem with the boundaries, refer to the national statistical authorities of these non-EU countries.

## Imputing to new boundaries with historical data

Eurostat released an untidy Excel document that contains all boundary changes from the `NUTS2013` to the `NUTS2016` boundary definition. You can load these tidy tables into your global environment with  `data("nuts_correspondence")` and `data ("regional_changes_2016")` or simply reference them as `eurostat::nuts_correspondence` and `eurostat::regional_changes_2016`. (The `eurostat::` part can be omitted if you have called earlier`library(eurostat)` in your code.)

Because NUTS3 level data is very scarce, we did not create a programmatic solution to filling in new boundaries for NUTS2 regions. 

However, using these correspondence information, many NUTS1 regions, when NUTS2 data is present in the data, can be filled in with historical data using simple equivalence or addition. 

```{r correspondence}
nuts_correspondence %>%
  filter ( nuts_level == 1 ) %>% 
  select ( code16, resolution )
```

For example, the new NUTS1 regions `FRB` is simply the continuation of the earlier NUTS2 region `FR24`. Or, the new NUTS1 region `FRC` can be filled with historical data with simply adding `FR26` and `FR43` NUTS2 data observations.

### Backfill to historical boundaries

When applying the latest boundaries (and visualizing according to current boundaries) is not important, it may be easier, or leave you with a larger panel of data if you use the correspondence information to backfill new, NUTS2016 data into the NUTS2013 boundaries, simply because you have more data following the earlier definition.

## Imputation strategies

There are many imputation methodologies implemented in various R libraries (see [CRAN Task View: Missing Data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MissingData.html)) You have to beware that most of these methods are not satisfactory in regional datasets. Whenever missingness is caused by boundary changes, it will certainly violate many imputation method's conditions.  For example, many imputation strategies work when missingness is random. Therefore, it is very important that you first align the boundaries, and then apply imputation.

Consider the following very simple, hypothetical example:

```{r example1, echo=FALSE}
tibble ( regions =c("A02 - from 2015 in D1 greater region", 
                    "B01 - from 2015 in D1 greater region", 
                    "C1", 
                    "D1 - from 2015 A02+B02"), 
         Y2014 = c(1,2,10,NA_real_), 
         Y2015 = c(rep(NA_real_, 4)), 
         Y2016 = c(rep(NA_real_,2), 10, 5))

```

How would you interpolate the missing 2015 data?  In the case of region `C`, there are no boundary changes, and the data seems constant. You would interpolate the value to be 10.  

However, in the case of the new `D1` region, we first reconstruct the sum of its smaller regions, `A02` + `B01` where we have historical data.  If `D1` region would have been defined as a region in 2014, its value would have been 3.  So the correct intrapolation is 4.

```{r example2, echo=FALSE}
tibble ( regions =c("A02 - from 2015 in D1 greater region", 
                    "B01 - from 2015 in D1 greater region", 
                    "C1 - 2015: intrapolated", 
                    "D1 - 2014: A02+B02"), 
         Y2014 = c(1,2,10,3), 
         Y2015 = c(rep(NA_real_, 2), 10,4), 
         Y2016 = c(rep(NA_real_,2), 10, 5))

```

You may still wonder if you should use the old boundary definitions, because `D1` had a higher resolution of data given it detailed the statistics to its constituent subregions, `A02` and `B01`. 

```{r example3, echo=FALSE}
data.frame ( regions =c("A02 - extrapolated with D1 data", 
                    "B01 - extrapolated with D1 data", 
                    "C1  - 2015: intrapolated", 
                    "D1 -  2014: A02+B02"), 
         Y2014 = c(1,2,10,3), 
         Y2015 = c(1.5, 2.5, 10,4), 
         Y2016 = c(2,3, 10, 5))

```

There are a few things to keep in mind when you start actually analyse the data. 

If you fill up your data set to both old and new boundary definitions, your dataset _appears to be bigger_, but it _does not contain more information_. Keeping both `A02 and B01` and `D1` in your panel duplicates the new D1 region in your panel which is formerly known as `A02` and `B01`. If you measure growth, you will overestimate average growth, because the high-growth region is duplicated in the dataset. You must remove either `A02 and B01` or `D1` from your panel, otherwise you will skew the effect that you analyse towards `D1`.

The use of the old boundaries makes sense if you have more data in the old definition prior to 2014.  In this case, your dataset will contain less estimated values if you stick to the historical boundaries, and extrapolate the discontinued `A02` and `B01` regions, and leave `D1` out of your models.

The use of new boundaries is useful when you have more data after Y2016. In this case, the switch to a lower geographical resolution (merging A02 and `B01` to `D1`) is balanced by the fact that you have more recent and more factual data about the less detailed `D1` observation.  In this case, backfilling via reverse extrapolation the `D1` data is the better strategy. You should leave `A02` and `B01` out of your further analysis.

# Suggestions for Eurostat


There are problems with Eurostat’s data products on two levels: with the data and with the metadata.

The data problems are affecting the work of national statistical authorities, because they are responsible for the creation, validation, and when necessary, the later correction of data.  Eurostat cannot change the data they submit; however, it can change harmonization methodology, guidelines, and when necessary, initiate change in statistical regulation.
I think that updating guidelines, and possible even regulation would not be controversial in the case when member states would be asked to provide the history of their statistics in the cases when the content of the data did not change, only its metadata, i.e. the labelling. If a member state changed the boundaries of a region, it may or may not be possible to re-calculate the data for this region. However, when only the name and short code changed, the data points are there, and they should be included in the data products.

Regarding metadata, Eurostat could improve its products without the involvement of member states.  The current problem with the metadata of the regional statistics is that they are not tidy and not fully consistent.  The variable column ‘geo’ in the statistical products in fact contains at least three different information: the level of aggregation, the label of the information in the NUTS2013 definition and the label of the information in the NUTS2016 information.  Depending on what view you take on the contents of the table, this means that a seemingly single data table in fact is an unlabelled join of three tables: a national data table, and two regional data tables following different regional boundaries.

The addition of the NUTS (or NUTS equivalent non-EU) level would already remove a lot of confusion and several metadata errors. The source of the confusion is that many products claim to contain NUTS2 information, but they contain a mixture of NUTS0, NUTS1 and NUTS3 information.  While the geo column can be easily filtered (by the number of characters of the geo code) this information is not known to all users. Adding the nuts_level variable in our case makes joining various data sources far easier and less confusing.

Several ways could be found to add the information currently contained in the (otherwise not tidy) Correspondence Table to each regional product.  This would require adding the information to which NUTS definition does the row (observation) in the dataset comply with.  It could be done in several ways from a data presentation and organization point of view. What should be minimally added is the NUTS definition (vocabulary) where the NUTS unit can be found, and potentially, as our helper functions do, further information about conversion.

A solution to the metadata presentation of the regional statistical products does not require the modification of statistical regulations (which must be adopted by the member states of the EU) and it is very urgent, because the next NUTS changes are already announced.

And at last, it would be a non-controversial change, which may require updating guidelines or regulations, is to add, at least on a non-mandatory basis, non-EU countries to the Correspondence tables.  It is very unlikely that EEA countries like Norway or potential candidate countries like North Macedonia would have objections to report their regional boundary changes to the Correspondence tables.  This is a self-evident change, which is also necessary after Brexit, given that the United Kingdom’s boundary data will have to remain in the Correspondence tables.
