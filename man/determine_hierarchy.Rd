}
\value{
Numeric
}
\description{
Divides the number of spaces before alphanumeric characters
with 4 and uses the result to determine hierarchy. Top level is 0.
}
\details{
Used in determine_hierarchy function to determine hierarchy.
Hierarchy is defined in Eurostat .txt format TOC files by the number of
white space characters at intervals of four. For example,
"    Foo" (4 white space characters) is one level higher than
"        Bar" (8 white space characters).
"Database by themes" (0 white space characters before the first
alphanumeric character) is highest in the hierarchy.

The function will return a warning if the input has white space in anything
else than as increments of 4. 0, 4, 8... are acceptable but 3, 6, 10...
are not.
